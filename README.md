# saveIt
Save all data input fields with webstorage HTML5 and Jquery

How it works:

1. Add jquery to your project.
2. Add the saveIt.js javascript to your project.
3. Give the class "saveIt" to every input field you want the browser to remember.
4. Give this input field a name.

saveIt saves all data of every input field to the local webstorage. 
It's a fast and safe way to keep data in inputfields even when the browser is closed or the computer is rebooted.
